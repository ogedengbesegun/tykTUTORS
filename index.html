        No nation can rise above level of its teachers —Prof Mopelola Omoegun
15th August 2021
Prof Mopelola Omoegun
Prof Mopelola Omoegun

By 
Tofarati Ige



Prof Mopelola Omoegun, a former Dean of the Faculty of Education, University of Lagos, is fondly referred to as the ‘doyen of guidance and counselling in Nigeria.’ She tells TOFARATI IGE about her career, teaching profession, marriage, childhood and other issues
What do you regard as the highlights of your career as a guidance and counselling professional?

I give all the glory to God for giving me the grace to finish well. I got to the peak of my career. I was not just a professor, but the Dean of the Faculty of Education (University of Lagos) as well. Of all the professors in a faculty, not all of them will become Dean. In my counselling profession, I became the pioneer national president of the Association of Professional Counsellors in Nigeria. Before then, we had the Counselling Association of Nigeria, where I was the national vice-president. I was the Lagos State chairperson (of the association) for almost 15 years. I am known nationally and internationally as a counsellor. It gives me joy when people talk to me as a counsellor. I was fulfilled when I retired at 70.

What were your childhood ambitions and how did you find yourself in guidance and counselling?

I believe counselling is not a job but a vocation; more like a calling. When I was young, people identified that trait in me and I also knew that I loved helping people. It is always my joy to see people happy, and that is the trait of a counsellor. But, the career wasn’t this popular when I was growing up. My father wanted his three daughters to become teachers. When we finished our primary education, he stopped us from taking modern school entrance examinations because he wanted us to be teachers. To him, the main (acceptable) professions for ladies was either teaching or nursing. I preferred teaching. By the time I completed Teachers’ Grade Two certificate exams, I had a good result, and the missionar, who was the principal of the school I attended, sent me to teach at the primary school which I attended. I started teaching and completed my Teachers’ Grade Two in 1969. However, my full-time teaching job started on January 2, 1970.




Because it was the school I attended, my desire was to make things better for the pupils. I wanted them to enjoy the things I didn’t enjoy as a pupil. I love music and dancing, and I had a radio then. I would play it for the children to dance with me, then I would proceed to tell them stories and listen to their stories too. Eventually, they grew fond of me and I got attached to them. Those are traits of a counsellor.

My principal sent for me once and told me that she had studied me a lot and had noticed that I would be a good counsellor. During my training, I joined the evangelical group and they observed how I was always helpful to the children and their mothers. One of the missionaries (from the United States of America) then discussed with the principal that I would make a good counsellor. The principal promised to sponsor me abroad for a Master’s degree in Counselling. However, when my father came, I informed him and he said he had never heard of that (guidance and counseling) in Nigeria. He said the only profession he knew for ladies were teaching and nursing. He then went ahead to get me a Nigeria Certificate in Education form from the University of Lagos. I attempted the exam and I did well, so my father told me to pursue a teaching career. That was how I left the primary school where I was teaching in September 1971 and went to UNILAG for NCE. By the time the missionary came back at the end of 1971, I had already left the school and they couldn’t trace me. When they heard that I was in the university, they were surprised. I went to visit them once and explained my reason for leaving. That was the first time I heard about counselling but I wasn’t privileged to study it.

What then happened?

Later on, I met Professor Olayinka (he was then a Dr). He had just come back from the US and he had a degree in counseling, so he was taking us in subsidiary subjects, rather than counselling. He discovered my interest in the course because I was scoring the highest grades, and we became fond of each other. He then started encouraging me to go into counselling. For my first degree, I studied Education but they had a subsidiary in Counselling, so I registered for that too and did very well. That was how Dr Olayinka encouraged me to go for a Master’s degree in Counseling.

When I went for my Master’s degree, I started doing some counselling in a school and I continued teaching there after my National Youth Service Corps scheme in 1978/79. The students then referred to me as their ‘counsellor’ and it was how they knew about counselling too. I was teaching Literature but I was acting as the school’s counsellor. Later, I was sent to the School of Basic Studies in Lagos State to start-up a remedial programme. So, I had the opportunity to practise counseling and that was how the love continued to grow. I was very committed to helping students, especially those who failed. Though that was about 40 years ago, many of them still remember me for my counselling services and how I helped them to change their lives.

What do you consider to be your greatest legacy as a teacher?

Right from my time as a primary school teacher, I have always loved children. One of my former pupils wrote an article that they were so proud of me because they could look up to me in the boarding house. I made them want to come back to school after every holiday. At Regal Memorial Girls Baptist Secondary School, Yaba, where I first taught when I came to Lagos, they were so fond of me. They had challenges because they were in their adolescent stage but I was able to understand their feelings. I usually engaged them during lectures and I made learning Literature fun for them. All the students I taught Literature loved it. As a matter of fact, some of my students who wanted to study Medicine are now lawyers because they didn’t want to miss my class. They passed my courses because I made it practical for them, I made them act plays instead of just reading them. I also took them for different competitions. Gbenga Adeyinka, the popular comedian, was my student and he always regarded me as a backbone.

When Gbenga Adeyinka was your student did you have any inkling that he will turn out to be a comedian, and what advice do you have for teachers as regards spotting the potential of students?

My advice is that no child is destined to be a failure. God has endowed every child with potentials and it is our job, as teachers, to identify such potentials and encourage them to maximise them.

As regards Gbenga Adeyinka, he was a playful student and I got closer to him. He had an I-don’t-care attitude but I knew that he was intelligent, so I had to encourage him by helping them to organise dramas, musical competitions, quizzes and debates. He showed interest in those activities, and there was a group of them that went with me for competitions. That developed his interest in talking and he discovered he could talk very well. When I told them to act plays, he and many others would participate and they were able to develop themselves.


Are you proud of him today?

Not only him. I usually encouraged them to find out what they could do effortlessly and do it diligently. I am always happy and proud of Gbenga and others in that field that are successful.

Some of your old students presented you with a gift recently, over 40 years after you taught them. How does that make you feel and how often do you get gestures like that?

It first happened when I celebrated my 60th birthday. My former students at Regal Memorial Girls Baptist Secondary School were present, and they presented me with an award. I was very elated and happy because many of them are now successful (in their various fields of endeavour).

My former students at Government College also decided to honour a former teacher and I was informed that my name came to the lips of almost all of them. They acknowledged that I was tough but they enjoyed my teaching and I impacted them positively.

One of them inquired if I knew his name. I told him the name rang a bell but I could not figure out the face. He said it was because he ‘troubled’ me back then. He revealed that he joined a bad group that influenced him but I was always available to speak to him and encourage him to leave the group. I was happy to hear his testimony. Even at the university level, my students attribute their successes to my pattern of teaching. During my last birthday, they presented me with awards and a cake that was baked in the form of a book. For days, I didn’t want anyone to cut the cake because I admired it a lot. Many of my students are now part of my family. My children regard them as our relatives.

What are the qualities needed to make one a good teacher?

The qualities are similar to that of a counsellor. A good teacher should be approachable and have listening ears. The essence of teaching is to impart knowledge, so a good teacher should be ready to carry their students along. Don’t rush them but rather, give them room to express themselves. As a good teacher, one should encourage one’s students to ask questions to develop their innate abilities. A good teacher should believe in the students and show it.

What do you consider to be the highlights of your time as the Dean of the Faculty of Education in UNILAG between 2012 and 2014?

My deanship was ordained by God. I did not come out to contest against anybody. People approached me that they needed somebody like me to take over at that time as their next dean. I gave them a condition that I would ask God for divine intervention. Then, I said if there was no other person to contest against me, I would know that it is God’s will for me to be the dean. And, that was exactly what happened. When I showed interest, there was no opponent. I guess God wanted to use me for some people. I assisted many people to get their promotions, which had been delayed. Some of them had lost hope after spending about eight years on a particular level. There were a lot of promotions then and many people were employed during my tenure. I was a godsend to many of them and they were happy.

I introduced different programmes for students who were not doing well. I also organised a counselling programme for students whose cumulative grade point average was below 2.0. I brought people from outside to talk to them about maximising their potentials. At the end of the year, I organised an end-of-year party and made sure all the lecturers got gifts.

Aside from that, when you talk about physical structures, we made a lot of progress. When I resumed as Dean, our faculty boardroom was in shambles, and many of us couldn’t get chairs to sit on. I changed the boardroom. The faculty hall now called the ‘glass hall’ had a sentimental attachment for me because I had my wedding reception there in 1975. I was able to renovate it from its bad state to a standard one.

Also, a telecommunications company, Airtel, approached me that they wanted to erect a kiosk in the faculty and promised to carry out any project we wanted. Some staff wanted me to demand for expensive phones for the administrative team but I wanted something that would benefit everyone, so I told them to renovate the glass hall. When they went to check it, they said it would be capital intensive, but eventually, they refurbished it.

I also started a welfare package, where all lecturers could make contributions on monthly basis. So, when any member is celebrating, we just take money from that purse. I ensured that people were happy and worked together as a family.

You were part of the judges at the Maltina Teacher of the Year Award. What were your takeaways from that experience?

I discovered that teachers were not being recognised like other professionals. People look down on teachers but what the organisers of the award did boosted the ego of teachers. It was a national competition, and we had two rounds of interviews to select the top ten. At the end of the day, we selected the best three. They were motivated to turn up for the competition, and they put in their best. We asked them about their methods of teaching. We did not make any subject more important than the other. We asked them for their students’ performances and allowed students to make recommendations, as well as the heads of their schools.

Can you share your experience as the pioneer dean of the Faculty of Education at Ajayi Crowther University?

Ajayi Crowther University is a mission school. The then Vice-Chancellor, a bishop, addressed us with an appeal to our conscience that the students were our children, and lecturers were expected to do their jobs well. That is unlike what obtains in some public schools where some lecturers don’t live up to expectations. In fact, that was one of the problems I had as a dean. I insisted that lecturers must attend their lectures promptly, instead of keeping students waiting. I had to call some lecturers on phone to inform them that their students were waiting for them and I know one particular lecturer who was unhappy with me because of that. He believed I was too strict. But in Ajayi Crowther, a lecturer would be penalised if they don’t go for lectures. Their VC believed so much in counseling, so I started their counselling (unit). I also set up seminars and workshops for parents.

The institution is a faith-based university that strictly frowns at drug abuse and other vices. When caught, I counselled those students and I wrote to the school management not to expel them, especially those in the final year. I was able to set good standards with the help of the VC who always listened to my advice.

What legacy did you leave behind as the president of the Association of Professional Counsellors of Nigeria?

To be a part of that association, one must have a qualification in counselling. I made sure we organised seminars and skills training workshops for counsellors to make them better. I also ensured I introduced them to current skills in counselling. At every monthly meeting, we had case studies through which we equipped counsellors with modern skills. We brought up cases they had handled or were unable to handle in their different schools and hospitals. They have taken it further since I left. Tthe current president has linked us up to international bodies to reach out and collaborate with some other professional bodies.

Religious leaders seem to have taken up the duties of counsellors. Do you think that is right?

In my church (Anglican), I used to counsel people. But, when the then-priest was transferred and another one came, the new priest insisted he was supposed to do the counselling. I didn’t struggle with him. For trained counsellors, we don’t mind the religion of the client, but we can’t say same for religious leaders. And, it’s not all problems they can handle. Some pastors go for counselling training and that is good. If they have the knowledge, they can apply it.

You’ve written eight books on counselling. What can you tell us about some of them?

The first one I wrote is titled, The Adolescent and You: Key to the Understanding and Successful Management of thr Adolescents with Counselling Strategies. That book was divinely inspired. I was motivated by God at a prayer fellowship. The message kept on coming to me that God had given me an assignment and I was yet to do it. I decided to pray when I got home and the inspiration I had was to check the Bible presented to me when I graduated from teachers’ training college in 1969. I looked in the Bible and I saw where I wrote, ‘The adolescent and you.’ I prayed and I had the inspiration that all my long essays after I graduated from the college had always been about the adolescent, so I looked through and said maybe that was the message God had been giving to me. I sat down and put all my long essays together. I discovered it was a calling to write that book to give a message to parents on how to manage adolescents. I did some research on the crisis adolescents go through. It is the same problem all over the world. It is usually referred to as the ‘transition period’ and is regarded as the turbulent period. I then wrote another book titled, Career Guidance for Nigerian Students, which is more about vocational counselling. It dwelt on how to make vocational choices and the role of parents in helping their children make good choices.

Another one is titled My Story Book on Values for the Nigerian Child. The last book I wrote which was launched on my birthday is titled, The Icing on My Cake: Memoirs of Mopelola, The Teacher and Counsellor at 70.

How would you describe your childhood?

My childhood was quite interesting. I grew up in a home that was very peaceful. My parents had six children but they lost one. So, five of us (children) grew up together. Our father was very energetic. He always encouraged us to do well in school and he gave us a lot of motivation. He was always very attentive to our needs. I tell people he lived according to his name, Omojola, which can be translated as ‘a child is more than riches.’ He was a railway man and he was being transferred from one station to another. So, he thought of how to give his children the best, even though they didn’t want girl children in their time. My mother had three girls in a row and I happened to be the third one, so it was as if I wasn’t even wanted when they had me. My father had only one wife. He learnt his lesson from his own background because his father was a polygamist and that was why he couldn’t go beyond secondary school level. Some of his classmates were Justice Kayode Esho and the first VC of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Hezekiah Oluwasanmi. He told us he was very brilliant but because his father had five wives, he had to stop his schooling after secondary school. His father also made it mandatory that he (my father) should start working so that he could finance the education of the other wives’ first born sons. It was very paramount to my dad that all his children would have university education. He was indeed a very caring and loving father. During Christmas, we (the children) would have our choice of any gift we wanted if we did well in our studies. So, we were always happy to be home and to do well in our academics. He always told us that we would enjoy life if we faced our studies, but would regret if we joked with our studies. As a child, my best period was during examinations.


How were you able to combine marriage, childbearing and your career?

It was quite interesting. Initially, it was rosy because I had been prepared for marriage by the missionaries in our school. I had my first child in February 1976 after my marriage in March 1975. However, problems started when my mother-in-law came (to live with us). I had my baby through a Caesarean Section due to foetal distress. My mother-in-law didn’t understand the meaning of that because she came from the village but I thought my husband should have put her through but he didn’t because he was the only son. I didn’t heal quickly from the cut but my mother-in-law wanted me to go to the kitchen as soon as she came to pound yam or make amala (yam flour). It was tough for me and some days, I would be crying, until a friend advised me to speak with my husband about the pain. He agreed but that was another battle because they said I wasn’t ready to pound yam because I was a university graduate. I was always crying but my father was ready to help. He sent my mother to us to help nurse the baby and prepare food then go back home at night. After some years, I discovered my husband was very rigid. Combining the home and academic work was God’s design. My husband was happy when I got my doctorate degree but then, there was no compromise. I had to give him attention at home. Once I was able to combine those, he didn’t have a problem. But whenever I came back home after 8pm, there would be punishment for that. I would have to sleep in the car or corridor. Or, if I went for a seminar without getting his approval, I would face the music. He was a tough man, even at his place of work. I thank God for His grace and the kind of orientation I had. I wasn’t going to leave my home. I had to stay with my children through thick and thin. At the end of the day, we made it.

How were you able to sail through that experience for the marriage to work?

It was by the grace of God, and because I know there was nowhere I could go back to. The day I got my doctorate, his friends came and they told him that after that day, I wouldn’t pound yam for him again. He told them he won’t eat any kind of processed yam. I heard him and I smiled. While serving them, I told him a doctorate degree won’t stop me from pounding yam for him and I kept pounding until I turned 50-year-old. It was then my children started helping me out.

When you’re not working, how do you unwind?

I am always working. I’m not tired and my children know I cannot stay at home doing nothing.

You mentioned that you like dancing. What kind of music do you like listening to?

I like juju, highlife and the new contemporary music.

These days, a lot of graduates don’t like to be teachers. How do you think the profession can be made more attractive to them?

I think that is what the Nigerian Breweries started (with Maltina Teacher of the Year Award). Teachers need to be encouraged, especially by the government. I have always said there is no job I can do that I would enjoy more than teaching. I was at a function over the weekend and they were discussing about a state where teachers had not been paid for months. How would a teacher remain in such a system? How will teachers function when they are not paid salaries? That’s why people don’t want to become teachers. Everybody wants to work in a bank or oil company. Some even go into event planning. No nation can rise above the level of its teachers. One cannot get to any height without a teacher. The art of teaching demands a level of commitment. One needs to be suitably qualified before one can become a teacher. Some students fail because they don’t understand the methods of their teachers. Every profession is unique and needs training to master it. Teaching is not excluded.
